## Installation

Download and install with npm. For **Vue 3**:

```bash
npm i vue-glitched-writer
```

**Vue 2**:
```bash
npm i vue-glitched-writer@1.0.8
```

Import inside the script tag.

```js
import GlitchedWriter from 'vue-glitched-writer'
```

Or use [Skypack](https://www.skypack.dev/view/vue-glitched-writer) to import without installing the package.

```js
import GlitchedWriter from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/vue-glitched-writer'
```

## Usage:

### Declare component

```html
<script>
export default { 
   components: {
      GlitchedWriter, 
   },
}
</script>
```

### Animate text instantly after load

Will animate blank -> passed text property

```html
<glitched-writer text="Your Content" appear />
```

### Write text dynamically

Animate each time the txt prop changes.
_Previous text -> new text_

```html
<glitched-writer :text="text" />
```

### Queue Writing

If you want to write texts for prepared array, then you can pass that array to as `text` and glitched writer will turn it into a working queue.

```js
data() {
   return {
      phrases: [
         'Hello and Welcome', 
         'What is this?!',
         'It appears i\'m in some queue...',
      ]
   }
}
```

```html
<glitched-writer :text="phrases" />

<!-- add prop "queue" to controll the queue -->
<glitched-writer 
      :text="phrases"
      :queue="{
      interval: 1200, // [ms]
      loop: true
      // false -> stop (default)
      // true -> continue looping
      // Function -> stop and fire the function.
      // Number -> wait number ms and continue looping
   }"
/>
```

### Using Presets

[List of available presets](https://github.com/thetarnav/glitched-writer#presets).

```html
<glitched-writer text="Your Text" preset="zalgo" />

<!-- Passing options prop will extend the preset -->
<glitched-writer text="Your Text" preset="zalgo" :options="{ html: true }" />
```

### Custom Options

See [Glitched Writer's Option List](https://github.com/thetarnav/glitched-writer#customizing-behavior).

#### **Passing options object to component.**

```js
{
   data() {
      return {
         text: 'Your Text',
         options: {
            html: true,
            letterize: true,
            steps: [0, 10],
            delay: [500, 2000],
            glyphs: 'QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM!@#$%^&*()1234567890'
         },
      }
   },
}
```

```html
<glitched-writer :text="text" :options="options" />
```

#### **Changing options later**

When changing options object (passed to the component), you need to remember to reassign the object property, instead of modifying it.

```js
{
   methods: {
      changeOptions(){
         // RIGHT
         this.options = {
            steps: [2, 15],
            html: false,
            ...this.options
         }

         // WRONG: this.options.steps = [2, 15]
      }
   }
}
```

### Pausing the animation

The "pause" boolean property is responsible for programatic pausing.
Simply set "pause" property to true if you want the animation to stop.

```js
data() {
   return {
      pause: true
   }
}
```

```html
<glitched-writer :text="text" :pause="pause" />
```

### Component Events

Glitched Writer emits 3 events:

-  **start** - when writer starts writing
-  **step** - on every step of writing process
-  **finish** - when writer finishes writing

```html
<glitched-writer @start="method" @step="callback" @finish="callback" />
```

```ts
{
   methods: {
      callback(text, data){
         console.log(text, data.options)
      }
   }
}

// WriterDataResponse: {
// 	string: string
// 	writer: GlitchedWriter
// 	options: Options
// 	state: State
// 	status?: 'ERROR' | 'SUCCESS'
// 	message?: string
// 	error?: any
// }
```

### Accessing GlitchedWriter Instance

If you want to do something custom with the component, you can use GlitchedWriter class instance attached to the html element.

```html
<glitched-writer :text="text" ref="el" />
```

```js
mounted(){
   console.log(this.$refs.el.$writer)
}
```
